--------------------------------------
This program takes in a FITS file and creates a Gaussian model for an emission line based on user input.

KNOWN BUGS/THINGS TO IMPROVE:
-Doesn't allow sufficient user confirmation.
-Only allows one analysis per run

TO USE:
Ensure that FITS files are in the same directory as specfit.py. Program will prompt you for the filename, edges of the mask, and the box width. A chart of the data will then appear. Click the edges of the desired area and then close the plot.
